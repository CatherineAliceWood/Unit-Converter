A solo project for the Scrimba Frontend Web Dev Career Path

## Notes:
- I've used UK gallons
- I've learned on Scrimba that accessing the DOM less frequently is better for efficiency of loading times etc so I've put all the querySelectors in consts at the top of the JS file
## If I was to develop this further I could:
- look at making the code DRYer perhaps with the calculations in an object accessed by looping through an array, but as Per from Scrimba says "first make it work, and then make it better!" and it works! So ðŸ˜ƒ
